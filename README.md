### Basic Configuration

```toml
[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080

[gateway]
name = "mcp-gateway"
environment = "production"

# Define upstream server groups
[upstream.groups.default]
strategy = "round_robin"

[[upstream.groups.default.servers]]
id = "mcp-server-1"
url = "ws://localhost:3001"
weight = 100

[[upstream.groups.default.servers]]
id = "mcp-server-2"
url = "ws://localhost:3002"
weight = 100

# Enable health checking
[upstream.health_check]
enabled = true
interval = 30
timeout = 5

# Configure security
[security.auth]
enabled = true
jwt_secret = "your-secret-key"

# Enable metrics
[metrics]
enabled = true
port = 9090
```

```toml
[upstream.groups.example]
strategy = "round_robin"
```

### Weighted Round Robin
Distributes requests based on server weights.

```toml
[upstream.groups.example]
strategy = "weighted_round_robin"

[[upstream.groups.example.servers]]
id = "server1"
weight = 200  # Gets 2x traffic compared to weight 100
```

### Least Connections
Routes to the server with the fewest active connections.

```toml
[upstream.groups.example]
strategy = "least_connections"
```

### IP Hash
Routes based on client IP hash for session affinity.

```toml
[upstream.groups.example]
strategy = "ip_hash"
```

## Security

### Authentication Methods

#### JWT Authentication
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>" http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

#### API Key Authentication
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: <api-key>" http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

#### Basic Authentication
```bash
curl -u username:password http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

### Rate Limiting

Configure rate limiting per client:

```toml
[security.rate_limiting]
enabled = true
requests_per_minute = 1000
burst_size = 100
key_strategy = "ip_address"  # or "user_id", "api_key"
```

[Unit]
Description=MCP Gateway
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=mcp-gateway
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mcp-gateway --config /etc/mcp-gateway/config.toml
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Performance Tuning

### Recommended Production Settings

```toml
[server]
workers = 8  # Number of CPU cores
max_connections = 10000
keepalive_timeout = 30

[upstream.connection_pool]
max_connections_per_host = 128
max_idle_per_host = 32

[middleware.timeout]
request = 30
upstream = 30
```

### Benchmarks

On a 4-core server with 8GB RAM:

- **Throughput**: 50,000+ requests/second
- **Latency**: <1ms p50, <5ms p99
- **Memory**: ~50MB baseline usage
- **Connections**: 10,000+ concurrent connections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Gateway won't start
```bash
# Check configuration
mcp-gateway --config config.toml --validate

# Check logs
mcp-gateway --config config.toml --log-level debug
```

#### Upstream connection failures
```bash
# Test upstream connectivity
curl -i --upgrade websocket http://upstream-server:3001

# Check health status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/upstreams
```

#### High latency
- Check upstream server performance
- Review circuit breaker settings
- Monitor connection pool utilization
- Verify network configuration

### Log Analysis

Enable debug logging:
```toml
[logging]
level = "debug"
structured = true
```

Key log fields:
- `request_id` - Trace requests end-to-end
- `upstream_server` - Track upstream routing
- `latency` - Request processing time
- `status` - Response status codes
